# Presentation : 
Better managing rental activity is a major challenge for real estate professionals. Qeeps reinvents the rental journey by offering a simple and flexible tool. Qeeps is aimed at professionals who seek to simplify the daily management of their rental, complete administrative procedures, and offer a new experience to prospective tenants. Qeeps is the platform that allows real estate professionals to free up time to generate more revenue.

## Objectif :
Create a Python script to read the application emails we receive for the apartments for rent from our partner agencies in order to redirect the candidate to Qeeps. To do this, we would like to have a script that easily adapts to different platforms (Seloger, Bienici), in order to retrieve the maximum amount of information about the application.
